# Why Happy Happy Joy?

## Hello and welcome!

Happy Happy Joy was born in the months following the sudden and entirely unexpected death of my darling 12 year old niece Angel. I remember all too well the relentless sadness following her passing. That feeling somehow evolved into a kind of numbness for the most part with episodes of grief that came and went without warning.

Then one day something happened - I can't for the life of me remember what - but it made me laugh, then immediately feel terribly guilty for having done so. And so I began to wonder... when is it going to be okay to feel okay again? And slowly it dawned on me how _horribly insulting_ it was to Angel to be still alive and **not really living...**

From that moment on I decided to be FREE TO BE unashamedly happy regardless of anything that life could fling my way. Which isn't to say that I'm cracking up when 'bad things' happen, but more so that I am not afraid to enjoy the joy in life even when the chips are down...

This is a new adventure, a new beginning for me so bear with me on my learning curve... :)
